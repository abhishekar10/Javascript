<h1 align="center">Javascript Roadmap Tracker</h1>
<p>Will be using this repo to track my learning progress of Javascript language</p>
<p>The expectations are to
<ol>
    <li>Create difficulty levels</li>
    <li>Each level to have certain number of questions</li>
    <li>Solve them and compare them with relatively more efficient/effective methods to solve them.</li>
    <li>Hang notes as comments on why the other methods are more efficient/effective.</li>
    <li>Also can be used as my own notes to look back</li>
</ol>
