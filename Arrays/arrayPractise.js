let myArray = []; //Create an array
/* 
 - Arrays in JS can store multiple data types (whaaaat??!?!?)
 - Oh wait, they are objects as well. 
So if use something like myArr[var] where var is not a non-negative value, the var is a key for the value???
myArr[-1] = 1 doesn't mean the last value of the array is 1, but a key value pair -1: 1.
